# Files generated by the PyQt6 tools
# The pyuic6 tool generates Python files from .ui files.
# It's a good practice to not commit these generated files.
# Instead, you commit the original .ui file and the script to generate it.
# Assuming a convention of naming generated files like 'ui_main_window.py'
# a better pattern is to use a more specific ignore.
# For example, if you generate ui_myform.py, you could add it explicitly.
# A more general pattern could be `ui_*.py` if you stick to that naming convention.
